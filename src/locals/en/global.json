I couldn't finish adding all the features I wanted because I didn't have the PRO version, but it's an app that works well.",

It is a real-time messaging application that uses proprietary libraries such as Express and Socket.io, so you can receive messages in real time from other people.",

I did it when I was 14 years old, and my goal was to create a WhatsApp clone where you could send messages to other people through a random number that was created when you registered your account. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it 100%, but the basic functionalities, such as sending real-time messages, work and show the knowledge I had at that age.",
